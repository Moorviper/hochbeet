LSB (resolution of ADC mV per unit)
10 bit DAC and Vref is 5V then the LBS is 5V/1024 = 4.88mV
11 bit DAC and Vref is 5V then the LBS is 5V/2048 = 2.44mV
12 bit DAC and Vref is 5V then the LBS is 5V/4096 = 1.22mV

10 bit DAC and Vref is 1,1V then the LBS is 1,1V/1024 = 1.074mV
11 bit DAC and Vref is 1,1V then the LBS is 1,1V/2048 = 0.537mV
12 bit DAC and Vref is 1,1V then the LBS is 1,1V/4096 = 0.268mV

10 bit DAC and Vref is 0,8V then the LBS is 0,8V/1024 = 0.781mV
11 bit DAC and Vref is 0,8V then the LBS is 0,8V/2048 = 0.390mV
12 bit DAC and Vref is 0,8V then the LBS is 0,8V/4096 = 0.195mV
